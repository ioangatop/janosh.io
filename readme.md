# [janosh.io](https://janosh.io)

This repo powers the [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) site hosted at [janosh.io](https://janosh.io). I use it to write about my personal interests, ranging from theoretical physics and machine learning to sustainability, web development and spending time outdoors... oh and not to forget breaking conventions.

The site is built with [**Gatsby**](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2018-06-16-announcing-gatsby-v2-beta-launch) and [**styled-components**](https://styled-components.com). It's fully responsive, relies heavily on React Hooks for stateful components and CSS grid for layout. It uses [**KaTeX**](https://katex.org) for typesetting math, [**Prism**](https://prismjs.com) for syntax highlighting, [**Disqus**](https://disqus.com) for blog post comments and [**Algolia**](https://www.algolia.com) for custom search.

Feel free to reuse any part of this repo to create your own Gatsby site.
