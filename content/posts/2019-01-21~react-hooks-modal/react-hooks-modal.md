What to do on a cold January weekend with bad weather? My choice fell on checking out the new [React Alpha (16.8)](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/11/27/react-16-roadmap.html#react-16x-q1-2019-the-one-with-hooks). **The one with hooks** as it's come to be called.

All it took was a little skimming through [the docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), followed by

```sh
yarn add react@next react-dom@next
```

inside the project folder. That's it. I was ready to start coding.

But what to do first? One thing that seemed a good fit for hooks are modals. I'd implemented them once or twice before and in both cases came away with the feeling that writing an entire class with all the boilerplate that goes with it is overkill considering the tiny bit of state management required for modal functionality.

Let's get straight to the code. This is what I ended up with.

```jsx
// components/modal/index.js
import React from 'react'

import { ModalBackground, ModalContainer, Close } from './styles'

const Modal = ({ open, closeModal, children }) => {
  return (
    <ModalBackground open={open} onClick={closeModal}>
      <ModalContainer onClick={event => event.stopPropagation()}>
        <Close onClick={closeModal} />
        {children}
      </ModalContainer>
    </ModalBackground>
  )
}

export default Modal
```

And as for the styles:

```js
// components/modal/styles.js
import styled from 'styled-components'
import { Close as Cross } from 'styled-icons/material/Close'

export const ModalBackground = styled.div`
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
  display: grid;
  visibility: ${props => (props.open ? `visible` : `hidden`)};
  opacity: ${props => (props.open ? `1` : `0`)};
  transition: 0.5s;
  z-index: 1;
`

export const ModalContainer = styled.div`
  align-self: center;
  justify-self: center;
  background: ${props => props.theme.white};
  max-width: ${props => props.theme.maxWidth};
  max-height: 80vh;
  position: relative;
  overflow: scroll;
  padding: 2em;
  border-radius: ${props => props.theme.mediumBorderRadius};
  box-shadow: 0 0 3em ${props => props.theme.black};
`

export const Close = styled(Cross).attrs({ size: `2em` })`
  position: absolute;
  top: 0.5em;
  right: 0.4em;
  cursor: pointer;
`
```

As you can see, the styles are way longer than the component itself. That's also where most of my time went. Figuring out how to use React hooks took minutes. Props to the React team (pun intended) for the excellent onboarding experience! Getting the css right probably took 10 times longer. Anyways, regarding usage, notice that the modal component doesn't actually handle it's own state. That's done by the parent component. As an example here's my list of [web projects](/web) projects on this very site.

```jsx{1,9,16,20}
import React, { useState, Fragment } from 'react'

import { ProjectExcerpt, Img } from './styles'
import Project from './Project'
import Grid from '../../components/styles/Grid'
import Modal from '../../components/Modal'

const Projects = ({ projects }) => {
  const [modal, setModal] = useState()
  return (
    <Grid min="15em" gap="1em">
      {projects.map(({ node }, index) => {
        const { title, cover } = node.frontmatter
        return (
          <Fragment key={title}>
            <ProjectExcerpt onClick={() => setModal(index)}>
              <Img fluid={cover.img.sharp.fluid} />
              <h3>{title}</h3>
            </ProjectExcerpt>
            <Modal open={index === modal} closeModal={setModal}>
              <Project {...node.frontmatter} html={node.html} />
            </Modal>
          </Fragment>
        )
      })}
    </Grid>
  )
}

export default Projects
```

Essentially only 4 lines of code suffice to control the list of modals and 3 of those do other things as well. All in all a big win for React hooks I'd say. Just compare to how much code the class implementation needed.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { connect } from 'react-redux'

import { toggleModal } from '../redux/actions'
import './Modal.css'

class Modal extends React.Component {
  componentWillMount() {
    this.props.closeOnClickOutside &&
      document.addEventListener('mousedown', this.handleClickOutside)
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    document.removeEventListener('mousedown', this.handleClickOutside)
  }

  handleClickOutside = event => {
    if (this.node && !this.node.contains(event.target)) {
      const { dispatch, name } = this.props
      dispatch(toggleModal(name))
    }
  }

  render() {
    const { modal, name, closeButton, toggleModal, children } = this.props
    if (!modal) return null
    return (
      <div ref={node => (this.node = node)} id={name + '-modal'}>
        {closeButton && (
          <button className="close-button" onClick={toggleModal}>
            &#10005;
          </button>
        )}
        {children}
      </div>
    )
  }
}

const mapStateToProps = (state, { name }) => {
  return {
    modal: state.modals[name],
  }
}

export default connect(mapStateToProps)(Modal)
```

Admittedly this component is bloated even further by using Redux but even without, this component is less readable and less maintainable. So thank you everyone involved for hooks.

One thing I should mention for future readers: Once Chrome's new [`<dialog>` html tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog) gets wider [browser support](https://caniuse.com/#feat=dialog), it would certainly be a good idea semantics' sake to use it for the modal container, i.e.

```js
- export const ModalContainer = styled.div`
+ export const ModalContainer = styled.dialog`
```

and then marbe use the `::backdrop` pseudo-element for the modal background.

```js
- export const ModalBackground = styled.div`
+ export const ModalContainer = styled.dialog`
    ...
    ::backdrop {
      ...
    }
  `
```

However, `::backdrop` would make it much difficult to close the modal on clicks outside of it, i.e. on the background since as of now, React is unable to attach the `onClick` prop to pseudo-elements. Not sure if that's going to change. If not, a workaround would be to instantiate an event listener with the new `useEffect` hook, but that would complicate things quite a bit, since the listener would have to trigger on all clicks and check that the modal doesn't include the target before closing.
