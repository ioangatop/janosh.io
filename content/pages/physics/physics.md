This is a compilation of notes and solutions to problem sheets for some of the physics lectures I took, most of them in Heidelberg.

During my studies, I often read the solutions to exercises uploaded by other physics students around the world. They usually opened up a new perspective or provided a way forward when I got stuck on a problem. In the hopes that I might provide similar help to others, Iâ€™m uploading some of the solutions I typed up over the years.
